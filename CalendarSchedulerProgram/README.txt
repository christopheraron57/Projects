This project was completed in ITCS-3112, a course on Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems. During this course, we had this project and we completed it in stages.

This course was simple, yet very helpful in learning how to stage projects before completing them. It also helped me realize that I enjoy programming in Object-Oriented languages.
